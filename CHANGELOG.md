## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **`/pipeline:init` environment detection Windows safety** — `commands/init.md` Step 1 (project detection, ~48 bash lines) and Step 3 (integration probe, ~64 bash lines) replaced with two Node scripts: `scripts/pipeline-init-detect.js` and `scripts/pipeline-init-integrations.js`. Both use `execFileSync` with argv arrays (no shell interpretation), `fs.existsSync` / `fs.readdirSync` (no POSIX for-loops), Node's `net.createConnection` (no `/dev/tcp` port probes), `http.request` (no `curl`), and `process.env.ProgramFiles` for Windows Postgres install detection (no hardcoded `/c/Program Files/PostgreSQL/*` MSYS paths). init now runs reliably under native Windows `cmd.exe` / PowerShell and Git Bash with spaces in install paths. Detection output is structured JSON; downstream init steps (1b gap-fill, 2 profile inference, 4 knowledge tier, 5 config generation) consume the same semantic fields the previous bash emitted. (#94)
- **Orientation preflight Windows safety** — `skills/orientation/SKILL.md` Step 1 chained-Bash block (`pwd && git rev-parse ... | wc -l`) replaced with `scripts/preflight-probe.js`, a Node script using `execFileSync` with argv arrays. Same six-field JSON output (cwd, repo_root, branch, head, worktree, dirty_count), no POSIX dependency. Eliminates silent breakage on `cmd.exe` and PowerShell; removes Git Bash fragility under install paths with spaces. All 8 phase commands delegate to SKILL.md via the caller-contract abstraction — byte-for-byte sync verified across `commands/{audit,build,commit,qa,redteam,review,remediate,finish}.md`. (#92, #93)

## [0.2.0-alpha] — 2026-03-26

V2 agent rewrite — code-based orchestrator, store-read pattern, and review circuit quality.

### Features

- Code-based orchestrator (`scripts/orchestrator.js`) — 13-step state machine, content-blind routing, `workflow_state` Postgres table, failure routing, loopback
- Data access layer (`scripts/pipeline-context.js`) — 9 query functions for structured context retrieval
- Architect command (`commands/architect.md`) — produces `docs/architecture.md` with typed contracts, security/testing standards, banned patterns
- Auto-embed (`tryEmbed` in shared.js) — vectorizes entries on insert, degrades gracefully if Ollama offline
- Semantic search — `workflow_discovery`, `agent_rewrites`, `code_index`, `findings` all vectorized
- `/pipeline:lint-agents` — deterministic structural lint for agent prompt templates. 7 checks across 3 categories (structural, security, consistency). Integrated into `/pipeline:commit` Step 3e. Config section `lint_agents` in pipeline.yml.

### Agent Rewrites (21/23)

- V2 store-read pattern — agents read their own context from stores (Postgres, GitHub, build-state, docs/architecture.md) instead of receiving pasted DATA blocks
- Three-store A2A reporting contract — every agent writes to Postgres + GitHub issue + build-state on completion
- ANTI-RATIONALIZATION blocks on all 18 prompt templates (role-specific per agent)
- Reporting Model documentation on all agents (self-reporting or orchestrator-delegated)
- Engagement style system in init (expert/guided/full-guidance)
- Security policy in init (every-feature/milestone/on-demand)

### Review Circuit Quality

- Cross-file contract verification — placeholder checklists traced across prompt templates and parent SKILL.md files
- Structural completeness audit — required v2 sections verified, dangling references caught
- Fallback symmetry — read/write pairs, GitHub-disabled guards, shell input validation
- Fix quality requirements — every HIGH finding requires replacement text + rationale + verification instruction
- Full audit of all 21 shipped agents against these 4 rules (42 findings fixed across 19 files)

### Other

- Search Efficiency directive in CLAUDE.md — Glob for file patterns, Read for full context, Grep only when location unknown

## [0.1.0-alpha] — 2026-03-24

Initial alpha release. Everything shipped to date in a single baseline.

### Features

- Size-routed quality gates — TINY/MEDIUM/LARGE/MILESTONE classification determines process
- Model routing — automatic haiku/sonnet/opus assignment by task complexity
- Config-driven architecture — single `pipeline.yml` per project
- Commit preflight gate chain — typecheck, lint, test, review gate with hard stop
- Parallel sector audit with cross-sector synthesis
- Security lifecycle — red team, remediate, purple team as a structured loop
- SBOM generation — CycloneDX 1.6 with transitive dependencies from lockfile parsing
- Knowledge tiers — files (markdown) or Postgres (semantic search via Ollama)
- Integration detection with graceful fallbacks (Postgres, Ollama, GitHub CLI, Chrome, Sentry, Figma, Stitch, PostHog)
- Cross-domain destructive operation guards (git, database, files)
- Big 4 dimensional awareness — functionality, usability, performance, security across all agent prompts
- Research folded into brainstorm verification gate
- Build crash recovery with `.claude/build-state.json` checkpoints
- Worktree lifecycle management — health check for merged, stale, dirty, orphaned worktrees
- Pre-inlined context for subagent dispatch
- Quick init mode (`--quick`) — zero-interaction setup with auto-detection and auto-install
- Project profile system — auto-detection of SPA, fullstack, mobile, API, CLI, library
- Phase 0 grep preprocessing for review and red team
- Severity tiers with confidence requirements
- Dashboard, UI review, markdown review, debug, test, simplify, release commands
